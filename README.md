Linfield Recruiting Data

I worked on the following porject to inform our coaching staff of how we can better recruit parts of the Western US. As a D3 football coach, 
you where many hats. I've been able to get a lot of experience managing our recruiting database over the years(Front Rush). I have managed, cleaned, 
and analyzed much of the data we've collected. The following project used Linfield Football recruit data from 2015-2022. 

Yearly our staff would sit down and make decisions on how best to utilized our resources in the recruiting of student athletes. Anyone who knows college
football knows that recruiting is the number one most imporant piece of winning football games. 

I have take out much of the identifying and personal information of the players that were in our program and those that we recruited. I have permission to
use said data set via head football coach Joseph Smith of Linfield Football.

Much of the data was very sparse at times. It took quite a bit of work to fill in the gaps that I knew personally, such as high schools and graduation years
of our former players. 

In this repo will be the data as well as the files for me data viz which I made in Tableau.
